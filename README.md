# qelectrotech-element-contrib
Duplicate elements but with different manufacturer references have been discarded on official collection and made available on this Github repository.

Adding some elements I use to update the documentation while renovating the house. Mainly using Wago and Hager components.
I will add also some elements for the new smarthome using mainly Shelly products.

__NOTE: due to the scale change and the exact units in all cabinet graphics I would recommend to set the grid in X direction to 9 instead of 10. The horizontal pitch for a unit is 18 mm  and therefore every grpahic element with a unit width of 1 HP ( or 1TE in german ) is exaclty 36 pixels in width.__
